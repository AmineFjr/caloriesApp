### Description

Welcome to our project, the CalorieApp. This project is a REST API that aims to help you understand how many calories are in your recipes.

Our API is designed to calculate the caloric value of any recipe based on the ingredients used. This feature can be of great help for those following a specific diet or just wanting to understand the nutritional impact of what they eat.

With our API, you can enter the details of your recipe, such as the list of ingredients and their quantity, and you will receive in return the total calorie count of the recipe. The API is capable of recognizing a wide range of ingredients, and we are constantly striving to improve it to include more nutritional data and ingredients.

CalorieApp was created with the goal of making calorie tracking easier and more convenient for everyone. Whether you are a chef, a nutritionist, a fitness app developer, or just someone who loves to cook at home, this API is designed to help you make informed decisions about food.

### Technical architecture

#### Express

Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web server framework for Node.js. It's commonly used for building APIs.

```sh
/myapp
  /node_modules
  /public
    /images
    /javascripts
    /stylesheets
  /routes
    index.js
    users.js
  app.js
  package.json
```
Explanation of directories and files:

- **node_modules/:** This directory contains all the npm packages that are used in your application.
- **public/:** This is the directory that contains all the static files which can be served directly by the server. It may contain sub-directories for images, JavaScript scripts, and CSS stylesheets.
- **routes/:** This directory contains files for handling different routes in your application. Routes define how the application responds to a client request for a specific URL, or a specific HTTP request type (GET, POST, etc.).
- **app.js:** This is the application's entry file. It creates the Express application, loads necessary modules, sets up routes and errors, and listens for connections on a specific port.
- **package.json:** This file contains various metadata about your project, including the application's dependencies.

Express.js is very flexible and allows developers to structure their projects as they see fit. Thus, this structure can be modified to suit the needs of your specific project.

#### Quasar

Quasar is a frontend framework based on Vue.js. It offers a rich set of components and features for developing responsive user interfaces.

```sh
/myapp
  /node_modules
  /public
    /images
    /javascripts
    /stylesheets
  /src
    /components
    /layouts
    /pages
    /router
  quasar.conf.js
  package.json
```

Explanation of directories and files:

- **node_modules/:** This directory contains all the npm packages used in your application.
- **public/:** This is the directory that contains all static files that can be served directly by the server. It may contain sub-directories for images, JavaScript scripts, and CSS stylesheets.
- **src/:** This directory contains the source code of your Quasar application. It includes the following sub-directories:
- **components/:** This directory contains reusable Vue.js components of your application.
- **layouts/:** This directory contains layout components, which are reusable "page skeletons".
- **pages/:** This directory contains page components, which are "filled" into layout components.
- **router/:** This directory contains the Vue.js router, which handles navigation between pages.
- **quasar.conf.js:** This is the Quasar configuration file. It defines a variety of settings for your Quasar application.
- **package.json:** This file contains various metadata about your project, including the application's dependencies.
